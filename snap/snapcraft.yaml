summary: svidvspc - A Powerfull Chess Tookit
description: |
  SCID vs. PC is a Chess Toolkit
  Shane's Chess Information Database is a powerful Chess Toolkit,
  with which one can create huge databases, run chess engines, and 
  play casual games against the computer or online with the Free 
  Internet Chess Server. It was originally written by Shane Hudson,
  and has received strong contribution from Pascal Georges and 
  others.
  Scid vs. PC began with bug-fixes for the computer-versus-player 
  features of Scid (hence the name), but has evolved into a solid 
  alternative with many new features and interfaces. The project 
  is authored by Stevenaaus and numerous contributors
