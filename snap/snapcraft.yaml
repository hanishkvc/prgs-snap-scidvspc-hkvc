  SCID vs. PC is a Chess Toolkit
  Shane's Chess Information Database is a powerful Chess Toolkit, with which one can create huge databases,
  run chess engines, and play casual games against the computer or online with the Free Internet Chess Server. 
  It was originally written by Shane Hudson , and has received strong contribution from Pascal Georges and others.
  Scid vs. PC began with bug-fixes for the computer-versus-player features of Scid (hence the name), but has 
  evolved into a solid alternative with many new features and interfaces. The project is authored by Stevenaaus 
  and numerous contributors
