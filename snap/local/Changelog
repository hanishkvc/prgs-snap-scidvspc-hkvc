* Initial experimental packaging of scidvspc as a snap package
* The Basic application works
* Have included the standard stockfish available in 16.04 lts
  release, in this snap package, in addition to the toga/fruit
  and phalanx included by scidvspc by default.
* Home interface of snap environment/setup is enabled for this
  package, so that one can access files in the users home dir.
  HOWEVER at a later stage, if snap adds support for having a
  common directory across snap applications, which is persistant
  even across snap remove and snap install of the snapified app,
  then home directory access may be removed and user file system
  access restricted to that snap environment common directory.
  NOTE: This is different from SNAP_COMMON or SNAP_USER_COMMON
  directories provided by snap to the snapified apps.
* TCL_LIBRARY, TK_LIBRARY env variables set to work with $SNAP
  filesystem setup, required to find init.tcl
* tm.tcl updated to work with $SNAP filesystem setup/hierarchy
  required to access msgcat, etc tcl modules
* Audio and Network interfaces of snap environment is not
  enabled currently.
* tdom and snack tcl packages installed, but currently the
  application is not able to access these. Have to debug
  and fix this
* Have added a desktop file to meet snap's requirement wrt
  unity7 interface using snapified apps.

svn-2906-20181115

* Have added the included stockfish into Analysis engines list
* Have fixed the Exec path in desktop file, so that the app can
  be started from xdg compliant window managers.

svn-2906-20181116

* Define TCLLIBPATH to point to relevant $SNAP based folders,
  so that additional tcl extension packages installed can be 
  found. Required to access snack and tdom

svn-3141-20201019

* Added base tag to snapcraft.yaml to work with newer snapcraft
  which use base snaps and multipass, instead of lxd and cleanbuild.
* Updated path used to refer to the starting snap folder used
  during build time by snapcraft, which inturn contains the
  snapcraft.yaml and other support files used to build the snap.
* Moved the support files in snapcraft snap folder to the local
  subfolder.
* The fresh build has picked up v4.21+ of scidvspc.

svn-3141-20201020

* Moved the support files in snapcraft snap folder to the local
  subfolder.
* tdom path added to TCLLIBPATH, so that it can be found.
* sound wav files now installed, in case if user wants to setup
  the sound path and use it.
* alsa interface setup, so that sound plays provided user explicitly
  connects the alsa interface.
* sounds folder is setup by default.
* add fontconfig to snap's runtime environement thro stage-packages.

svn-3141-20201021+

* explicitly ensure libsnack and inturn tcl-snack work through alsa
  and not oss.
* add audio-playback to list of required interfaces (i.e plugs of
  this snap).
* make figurines font available to the program at runtime.

svn-3144-20201022
* enable network interface
* enable network-observe interface/plug, so that ping to fics can work.
  user needs to explicitly connect this.
